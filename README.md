## :wrench: INTRODUCTION

This website is built using just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've created a simple, single-page website that retrieves information from another website and displays it here. Through this project, I've learned how to test and improve site design, allowing me to create mock-up websites with real information and gain a deeper understanding of how websites work behind the scenes.
